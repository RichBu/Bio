                    Before on-line testing, teachers would use bubble sheets where students would 
                    fill in the bubbles. Students were always told to use a #2 pencil. To grade the tests, 
                    teachers would have have to run the tests through a machine. In addition, to having to 
                    wait their turn to grade, the machines were not accurate. I developed an app and PC program
                    that uses computer vision techniques. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My detecton technique turned out to be SUPERIOR to the machine. My software is able to detect 
                    the manual marks whether they are drawn by pencil, pen, marker, no matter what the color. 
                    The technique I developed I nicknamed <b>uniformity coefficient</b>. The software 
                    looks how uniform the printing is. A manual mark, no matter what color it is in, will not 
                    create a uniform mark, which allows the software to detect human marks.<br/><br/>
                    <b>Summary:</b><br/>
                    All of routines are native and run on iPhone and Windows directly. OpenCV was not used because 
                    it was too heavy weight to load. Deskewing, edge detection, and color detection was all done by 
                    reading the bitmap directly. All of the testing was done in MatLab prior to coding.<br/><br/>
                    <b>Technologies used:</b><br/>
                    Computer Vision (CV) using custom coding, Bitmap reading,  bitmap manipulation, uniformity calculation, writing to bitmap with colors and text, 
                    deskewing.

                        First, the digital image is created so students can not alter their 
                        marks. Secondly, by circling the wrong answers the teacher can quickly see 
                        if perhaps the student did not mark it could enough. <br/>

                        It looks for how uniform the printing is. No matter how dark the mark is, a human mark is never 
                        uniform if examined by my algorithm. So, the color of the marking does not matter no matter what color 
                        the background is.  <br/><br/>
