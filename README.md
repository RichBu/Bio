# Bio / Portfolio

Entry page for my portfolio.  Used to be a react page thaat showed all of my skills.  Software developeers just wanted to see examples of my software.  So, created this entry landing page which then has a fork over to my React page and also a simple portal.  

In addition, all of the other pages are left as simple HTML pages. This allows for 
the pages to be searched in SEO engines.
